## Background on News Deserts:

News deserts are communities with limited access to credible and comprehensive news -- are especially prevalent
in rural America. More than 500 of the 1,800 newspapers that have closed or merged since 2004 were in rural
communities.

In a report released earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that about half of U.S. adults (47%) say the
local news they get mostly covers an area other than where they live.

## Library x Newsroom Collabs

From our interviews with KCQ, Manor Ink, NowCastSA, and Local Lives, we realize that both libraries and new organizations play an important role in providing information to a community. Newsroom often write the first draft of a community's history, while libraries preserve its access.

## Our Solution

The origin of the word Palimpsest is used for something reused or altered but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form. It can be used for material documents as well as larger scale urban lanscapes. Our project acts as a bridge between the physical and the the digital, lost historical data and community members by allowing them to share archival pictures on our platform.

Our solution, "Palimpsest", introduces a prototype that encourages communities to share their moments and their local history. The act of sharing memories allows for connections to be drawn between community members and creates a sense of belonging and unity within the neighborhood.
