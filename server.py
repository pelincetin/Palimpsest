Still, the devastation caused over the course of the past few years by these floodwaters pales in comparison to the destruction amassed in just a few short hours by the work of large machines designed to destroy.",

		"Description": "Heavy rainfall during the evening of September 30th and the early morning hours of October 1st, estimated by some to total six inches of rain, drenched Livingston Manor and its surroundings, quickly filling the previously water-starved local streams and creeks with floodwaters. Considering the experiences from the recent flooding events at the Manor, this episode would probably be considered minor; unless, of course you are one of the residents still remaining in the flood prone areas.",

In what sounded like the repeated percussion of cannons, the propane tanks alongside the Hoos building exploded, sending shock waves that broke windows and could be felt throughout the downtown section of the village as far away as Peck's Market.",

These hides assumedly date back to the nineteenth century tannery of Wm. Ellswoth & Co. that was located at what is now the Beaverkill Campsite, next to the bridge.",
